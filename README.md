# argparse_tidyverse

Builds on the [rocker/verse](https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html) image
that contains tidyverse, RStudio, and publishing tools such as rmarkdown, quarto, and TeXLive.

The primary purpose for creating this image is to add a couple heavily used packages, which currently include:

- [argparse](https://github.com/trevorld/r-argparse)
- [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
